# Tennis Ace Project

This project is part of a machine learning course focused on using linear regression. By utilizing linear regression, the study analyzes and selects different performance features to improve the model accuracy of predicting different outcomes for [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals) players ranked in the top 1500 from 2009 to 2017.. The methodology involves training and evaluation different features and models, using the coefficient of determination (R²) as the primary metric for performance.

## Features

- Model Development: Utilizes linear regression to predict ATP player outcomes based on historical data, using a training-testing datasets to fit and assess the model.
- Performance metric: Employs the coefficient of determination (R²) to evaluate the models predictive power.
- Feature Optimization: Examination of model-generated scores to evaluate and identify the effect of different features and their impact on model precision.

## Setup and installation
You can see the Jupyter Notebook [here](StreetEasy%20Model.ipynb) or can install it locally using the next steps:

**Prerequisite**: This project requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can find installation instructions at the [documentation](https://jupyter.org).

To set up and show the notebook locally, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Joel-Milla/Tennis_Ace.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook to access the .ipynb files.
3. Run cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
